# Project 4
+ By: Ian Callahan
+ Production URL: <http://p3.iancallahan.dev>

## Improvements based on P3 peer review feedback
-Prettified code
-Reorganized pages/components
-Gave the favorite button more normal behavior
-Appreciated feedback about data properties and objects but decided to leave as-is because the real issue is that I'm not using a real server/API that can deal with individual requests. This is the structure I would prefer for those requests if they were not being faked here. 

## Outside resources
-This GitHub issue helped me figure out how to deal with my complaint confirm dialog in e2e testing: <https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/621>


## Notes for instructor
Thanks for a great class. Had some crazy family stuff going on so I appreciate your generous late policy. And the way you structured the notes/class website was very helpful.
