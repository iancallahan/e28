# Project 3
+ By: Ian Callahan
+ Production URL: <http://p3.iancallahan.dev>


## Outline of features
I chose to create an (admittedly very ugly) blog SPA that implements: 
*Homepage that shows a list of posts
*Show an individual post
*Filter posts by categories
*Option to go to previous/next posts
*Add a post to favorites list (local storage)
*View favorites list


## Outside resources
I used JSON Generator: <https://www.json-generator.com/>
This Stack Overflow helped me debug filtering: <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2722159/how-to-filter-object-array-based-on-attributes>

## Notes for instructor
Sorry it's late once again!
